# WearItForward
Wear It Forward is a student-led nonprofit organization dedicated to making clothing donations simple and accessible while reducing textile waste and helping those in need in our community.

Our mission is to create a sustainable cycle of giving by making the donation process as hassle-free as possible, while ensuring clothes find new homes where they're truly needed.
